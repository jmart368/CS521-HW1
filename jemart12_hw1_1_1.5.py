# A math problem can be done in several ways
# Always remember to set the variable for your formula
# This can be done by braking up the problem into seperate varaibles

numerator = (9.5 * 4.5 - 2.5 * 3) # set a numerator variable
denominator = (4.5 - 3.5) # set a denominator varaible
# You can also create variable instead creating two

result = numerator / denominator # combine both variables into one result
print("The result of 9.5 * 4.5 - 2.5 * 3 / 4.5 - 3.5 is", result)
